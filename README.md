Getting Started With Node Craft
===================================

Create Node CLI App with Based Shell. The following commands below are to be run in the Terminal.App for Mac OSX or Linux.

## Technology
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) A JavaScript runtime.
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js.
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) A BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

Setting up
------------
Assuming your project is in a folder named "Project" on your Desktop.

### Run on Project
	cd ~/Project Directory
	npm install
	type node . for run project
	type exit for exit project

### Install Globally.
- Determine your SSH clone url. On Github it's probably something like ***git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT.git***. Should be on the project's page somewhere.

		cd ~/Desktop
		git clone {{the link you just copied}} Project

- This creates a directory named "Project", clones the repository there and adds a remote named "origin" back to the source.

		cd Project
		git checkout develop

- If that last command fails

		git checkout -b develop

Updating/The Development Cycle
------------
You now have a git repository, likely with two branches: master and develop. Now bake these laws into your mind and process:

####You will never commit to ***master*** directly.
####You will never commit to ***develop*** directly.

Instead, you will create ***feature branches*** on your machine that exist for the purpose of solving singular issues. You will always base your features off the develop branch.

		git checkout develop
		git checkout -b my-feature-branch

This last command creates a new branch named "my-feature-branch" based off of develop. You can name that branch whatever you like. You should not have to push it to Github unless you intend to work on multiple machines on that feature.

Make changes.

	git add .
	git commit -am "I have made some changes."

This adds any new files to be tracked and makes a commit. Now let's add them to develop.

	git checkout develop
	git merge --no-ff my-feature-branch
	git push origin develop

Releasing
------------
Finished with your project?

- Create a feature branch as normal.
- Update the version history in the README.md file
- Update this to develop as normal.

		git checkout master
		git merge --no-ff develop
		git push origin master
		git tag v1.0.0
		git push origin v1.0.0

Replace 1.0.0 in the snippet here with your appropriate versions. Now you have a tag saved.
